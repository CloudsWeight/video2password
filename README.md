# video2password

Work in progress.


Video -> Audio -> Text -> rockyou.txt  

Input video and use the transcript produced to write a plausible password list file.

Use the example.ogv file to test it out from the command line.

From the command line navigate to the directory you downloaded the repository to, then type:

python3 video2password.py
